description = "I grew up in the south of Holland with a passion for mathematics, physics and business. After spending some time on the TU in Delft I switched to Business administration, because I think the link between technology and business is the holy grail :). Did some jobs/companies after that and ended up trading hardware from datacenters. This gave me an insight in the energy use of these datacenters, so now I'm using the waste energy as a heating source. Vacation often revolves around sports, weather it is Skiing, sailing or golf. Expecting to be father in June "
why_threefold = "So I’m active in the datacenter / renewable energy sector. Next to that I’m an enthusiast about the opportunities that Blockchain can bring us, apart from the transfer of money. I think Threefold is a nice intersection between my working field and interests. In my work I come across a lot of people who are working on projects, where they need to be facilitated with a digital infrastructure like VM’s and Kubernetes. In part we can accommodate them with the necessary services, but services like geo redundancy is something we cannot offer at the moment without the help of a platform like threefold. Next to that it might be an interesting administration and virtualization tool. "
